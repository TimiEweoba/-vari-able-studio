2) Extracted color palette (from the screenshot)

I sampled the screenshot and extracted the dominant colors (6 clusters). Use these for accurate styling.

#141517 — Very dark near-black (primary background / deep page background)

#232426 — Dark charcoal (secondary background / large section cards)

#504c4c — Muted slate gray (mid card/background, muted text panels)

#f47047 — Warm orange accent (primary CTA, badges, highlights)

#7f7f81 — Neutral gray (muted UI elements, metadata)

#b2aba8 — Light warm gray / beige (subtle text, secondary accents)

Usage guide

Background: use #141517 as the main page background.

Section cards / surfaces: #232426 and #504c4c for depth layers.

Primary CTA & accents: #f47047 (buttons, small icons, hover states).

Body text (light on dark): use off-white (#f5f5f5) for main copy; use #b2aba8 for secondary text.

Borders & subtle separators: #7f7f81.

3) Visual / pattern brief (how the page is built)

Overall aesthetic

Dark theme with high contrast: deep charcoal/near-black backgrounds + bright accent orange. Serious, modern, tech-forward.

Minimal UI: lots of negative space, clear visual hierarchy, large headings and compact supporting text.

Typography

Modern sans-serif (clean, geometric, medium weight for headings, regular for body).

Big hero headline, smaller condensed subheads for metric/labels.

Layout & components

Multi-section vertical scroll with clear section anchors.

Large hero with two-column layout (copy left, demo card right).

Card grids (work / projects) with muted images and orange numbered badges.

Services displayed as feature cards; process is a numbered step grid.

Analytics section uses KPI cards + small charts; use minimal chart styles with orange highlights.

Pricing uses three-column plan cards with one highlighted plan.

Imagery & icons

Abstract / product photography in desaturated tones to match dark theme.

Icons are minimal, geometric, and often outlined or small-filled shapes.

Visual emphasis on data visuals and product screenshots.

Micro-interactions (necessary)

Subtle reveal/slide animations on scroll.

Small hover lift on cards; CTA brightens to solid orange.

Metric counters animate when scrolled into view.
